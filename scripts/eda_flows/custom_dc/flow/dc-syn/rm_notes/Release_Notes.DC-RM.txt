D-2010.03-SP1
=============

General Updates
---------------

*  A new option named Physical Guidance has been added to the RMgen interface on
   SolvNet.

   This option configures the flow to pass physical guidance information to
   IC Compiler. This information can improve area and timing correlation and
   place_opt runtime.

   When you enable this option in the Design Compiler Reference Methodology, you
   should also enable the Physical Guidance option in the IC Compiler Reference
   Methodology.

*  The Leakage Power Optimization option in the RMgen interface on SolvNet has
   been updated.

   This option controls whether leakage power optimization is performed and whether
   the optimization is based on the leakage power of cells in the libraries or the
   number of low threshold voltage cells in the design.


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The set_clock_gating_style example for clock gating setup has been updated:

   set_clock_gating_style -posedge {integrated} -negedge {integrated} \
                          -control_point before ...

*  New support has been added for the multithreshold voltage constraint.

   Use this constraint to limit the number of low threshold voltage (Vt) cells
   in the design. This constraint is supported only in DC Ultra topographical mode.

*  Support has been added for the Consistency Checker utility.

   This utility checks for inconsistent settings between Design Compiler and
   IC Compiler that can contribute to correlation mismatches.

*  A new AutoFix configuration section has been added to the design for test (DFT)
   setup.

   o  The section includes a new dc.dft_autofix_config.tcl example file.

   o  A new DCRM_DFT_AUTOFIX_CONFIG_INPUT_FILE filename variable has been added.


Unique Changes in dc.tcl
------------------------

*  New support has been added for passing physical guidance information
   to IC Compiler.

   This information can improve area and timing correlation and place_opt runtime

*  The on-chip clocking configuration example file contents have been updated.

   In addition, the file name has been changed to dc.dft_occ_config.tcl.


D-2010.03
=========

Lynx Compatibility
------------------

This release introduces Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology
scripts, which you can select in RMgen on SolvNet.

For more information about the Lynx-compatible reference methodology scripts, see
SolvNet article number 029774 at https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/029774.html.


Directory Structure Changes
---------------------------

The reference methodology directory structure has been reorganized for all
versions of the product reference methodologies.

*  The setup files have been moved to a new directory named rm_setup.

*  The scripts directory has been renamed rm_<prod>_scripts, where <prod> is
   the product identifier: dc, icc, pt, or tmax.

These changes are the same for every product reference methodology and apply to
both the standard and Lynx-compatible versions of the reference methodology scripts.

The working directory structure depends on whether you are using a standard
reference methodology flow or a Lynx-compatible reference methodology flow.

Note:
   The hierarchical flow is not yet available for the Lynx-compatible version
   of the reference methodology scripts. If you select both the Lynx-compatible
   version of the scripts and a hierarchical flow, RMgen generates the
   Lynx-compatible scripts for a top-down flow.


General Updates
---------------

*  For ease of customization, the Design Compiler Reference Methodology now uses
   DCRM_* variables for all input, output, and report files.

   o  A new file, rm_setup/dc_setup_filenames.tcl, has been added to customize
      these variable settings.

   o  The default values are backwards compatible with older releases.

*  A new value, SCRIPT, has been added for the RTL Source Format option in RMgen.

   This option allows you to use custom scripts for reading the RTL source files
   in Design Compiler and Formality.


Changes in dc_setup.tcl
-----------------------

*  The ICC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS variable is not included if you selected a
   multivoltage hierarchical flow in RMgen.

   IC Compiler interface logic model (ILM) blocks are not supported in a
   multivoltage hierarchical flow.

*  The IC Compiler ILM link library setup is omitted for a multivoltage
   hierarchical flow


Common Changes in dc(_top).tcl
------------------------------

*  The auto_insert_level_shifters_on_clocks setting has been added for the
   multivoltage flow.

*  Support has been added for using an RTL read script in both Design Compiler and
   Formality.

*  The set_voltage script is no longer forced as a required input.

   o  The set_voltage commands could be applied as a part of the Synopsys Design
      Constraints (SDC) version 1.8.

   o  The "check_mv_design -power" command has been added to ensure that
      set_voltage has been set on all supply nets.

   The script exits if any settings are missing.

*  The path groups section has been updated with a more efficient way of getting
   clock ports:

   'set ports_clock_root \
       [filter_collection [get_attribute [get_clocks] sources] object_class==port]'

   This change is also preferred for previous releases.

*  The compile_clock_gating_through_hierarchy variable for enabling hierarchical
   clock gating has been added to the clock gating setup.

   This variable is commented out by default.

*  A comment has been added to enable leakage power optimization only for
   multiple threshold voltage (Vt) libraries.

*  The set_power_prediction section has been updated to enable power prediction
   by using clock tree estimation.

   The default tool behavior for power prediction was changed to off by default in
   Design Compiler version D-2010.03.

*  The floorplan input section has been updated to take three types of physical
   constraints. The preferred options for use when generating these files from
   IC Compiler have also been added.

   o  Design Exchange Format (DEF) (extract_physical_constraints)
   o  Floorplan file (read_floorplan)
   o  Tool command language (Tcl) constraints (source with fuzzy matching controls)

*  The write_physical_constraints command has been replaced with the
   write_floorplan for saving the floorplan in topographical mode.

   The write_floorplan command replaced the write_physical_constraints command in
   Design Compiler version D-2010.03.

*  The recommendation to use the -area_high_effort_script option with the
   compile_ultra command has been removed. In addition, this command option is
   no longer used by the QoR Strategy option for generating the scripts in RMgen.

   The -area_high_effort_script option does not change the behavior of the
   compile_ultra command, which is tuned to provide good area optimization
   results.

*  For multivoltage flows with test, a recommendation has been added to apply the
   set_related_supply_net command on newly created test ports if you are using the
   set_related_supply_net command on input or output ports of the design.

*  The options for set_dft_signal and set_dft_connect were reordered for
   consistency.

*  Information about the -location option of the set_scan_compression_configuration
   command has been added to specify where to insert compressor and decompressor
   logic for DFTMAX adaptive scan compression.

*  Additional verbose reports have been added for the dft_drc and preview_dft
   commands. These reports are generated by default prior to scan insertion.

   You no longer need to rerun the flow to generate these reports for debugging.

*  The -timing_high_effort_script option has been added for incremental
   compile_ultra optimization after scan insertion if -timing_high_effort_script
   was used with the initial compile_ultra optimization.

   Support for the -timing_high_effort_script option with incremental compile_ultra
   optimization is new in Design Compiler version D-2010.03.

*  The SDC output has been changed to use version 1.8 as the default.

   o  This version adds set_voltage commands to the SDC output for a multivoltage
      flow.

   o  Older releases should still use "write_sdc -version 1.7" to avoid problems.

*  A script has been added to capture an image of the congestion map in the layout
   window from a batch script run in topographical mode.


Unique Changes in dc.tcl
------------------------

*  To verify the correct preservation of interface timing information for the
   hierarchical flow, the compare_interface_timing flow has been added to
   create_ilm.


Unique Changes in dc_top.tcl
----------------------------

*  The -master_instance option has been added to set_physical_hierarchy to handle
   multiple instances.

   Beginning with version D-2010.03, errors occur if set_physical_hierarchy is
   applied to more than one instance of the same design.

*  The section used to write out the top-level design in the hierarchical flow
   has been updated.

   Beginning with version D-2010.03, IC Compiler ILMs, Design Compiler ILMs, and
   DC Ultra topographical mode Synopsys logical database format (.ddc) hierarchical
   designs are skipped automatically by the write command.


Changes in fm.tcl
-----------------

*  The signature_analysis_allow_subset_match variable has been added to the list
   of variables for the Formality automatic setup configuration.

*  Information has been updated for verification_set_undriven_signals, which is
   now set to a value of synthesis in the Formality automatic setup configuration.

*  Support has been added for using an RTL read script in both Design Compiler and
   Formality.

*  A upf_use_additional_db_attributes variable setting for the multivoltage flow
   has been added to ensure that Formality does not apply retention settings to
   instantiated integrated clock gating (ICG) cells.

   This behavior is consistent with Design Compiler behavior.

*  A new report_setup_status section has been added to report design statistics,
   design read warning messages, and user-specified setup information prior to
   matching.

   This section is optional and is commented out by default.

*  The analyze_points command has been added for unsuccessful verifications.


C-2009.06-SP1
=============

*  Added the following additional options to the adaptive scan compression
   configuration:

   o  High X-tolerant adaptive scan compression
   o  Low power gating with adaptive scan compression

*  Added the on-chip clocking configuration section to the design for test (DFT)
   setup

   o  Included new dc.occ_config.tcl example file when on-chip clocking
      configuration flow is chosen


dc_setup.tcl changes: none
--------------------

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  Removed the recommendation to use -site_row with write_physical_constraints
   or report_physical_constraints

   This is now the default behavior in the C-2009.06-SP1 release.

   Added information about using -no_site_row instead to skip writing out the site
   rows in the physical constraint output files.

*  Added high X-tolerant adaptive scan compression options

*  Added on-chip clocking configuration section to DFT setup
   o  Included new dc.occ_config.tcl example file
   o  Added additional dft_drc command for all bypass mode to DFT output reports

*  Reorganized DFT output file section to avoid redundant code
   o  Only the adaptive scan compression section is commented or uncommented


C-2009.06
=========

*  Changed "set" to "set_app_var" when setting application variables in all scripts.

   o  This is recommended to flag cases where variable names might be misspelled.
   o  This is also recommended for all older releases.

common_setup.tcl changes: none

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  Added multicore optimization setup using the "set_host_options" command.

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  Updated comments regarding use of the -site_row and -pre_route options for
   physical constraints.

*  Updated comments to indicate that the -num_cpus option should no longer be
   used to enable multicore optimization with compile_ultra.

*  Set write_sdc to write out version 1.7 for backwards compatibility.

   o  SDC has been updated to version 1.8, which is default in C-2009.06.
   o  SDC version 1.8 adds "set_voltage" settings to the SDC file.
   o  You should continue to use the ${DESIGN_NAME}.set_voltage.tcl file for the
      multivoltage flow until the flow is fully qualified with SDC version 1.8.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Removed read_test_model for IC Compiler ILMs when DFT flow is not selected
   (bug fix)

fm.tcl changes:
---------------

*  Added the -no_pg option to the "read_milkyway" command for reading Milkyway
   designs from Design Compiler to prevent automatic linking to power-aware
   versions of the cells.

   o  This is needed for new "read_milkyway" behavior in C-2009.06 Formality version


B-2008.09-SP4
=============

*  The IEEE 1801 multivoltage hierarchical flow has been added to the
   Design Compiler Reference Methodology in this release. IEEE 1801 is also known
   as Unified Power Format (UPF).

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added the following common hierarchical flow variables for tools to share
   information about hierarchical block names:

   o  HIERARCHICAL_DESIGNS
   o  HIERARCHICAL_CELLS

*  Added the LIBRARY_DONT_USE_FILE variable for tools to share the library
   dont_use modification script.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  For the UPF hierarchical flow, the search path is updated automatically
   with the path to ${RESULTS}.  This allows Formality to find the output
   UPF files.

*  The dont_use file is now specified by LIBRARY_DONT_USE_FILE in the
   common_setup.tcl file.  This file will automatically be read in if it
   exists.

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  The operating conditions example in the script is now commented out.

   Remember to define the operating conditions correctly for your design.

*  The create_voltage_area command settings are now sourced from a design
   setup script if it exists: ${DESIGN_NAME}.create_voltage_area.tcl.

   This makes it easier to manage multiple setups for multiple blocks in a
   hierarchical flow.

*  The extract_physical_constraints command is now wrapped to check for the
   existence of the DEF file or else continue otherwise.

   Although the DEF file is highly recommended, it is not an absolute requirement.

*  The compile_ultra -check_only command information has been updated to
   recommend using the same options that are used for the subsequent
   compile_ultra command.

*  DFT signal type definitions are now sourced from a file:
   ${DESIGN_NAME}.dft_signal_defs.tcl

   o  Example settings are now commented out.
   o  This makes it easier to manage multiple setups for multiple blocks
      in a hierarchical flow.

*  The following command is now commented out in all flows:

   set_dft_drc_configuration -clock_gating_init_cycles 1

   The comments have been enhanced to explain when this
   should be used.

   This change can be applied to previous releases as well

*  The -capture_procedure multi_clock option has been removed from
   the create_test_protocol command.

   This is the default behavior since the B-2008.09-SP2 release.

*  An extra check_mv_design command has been added, without the -verbose
   option, to provide a quick summary report.

   The additional -verbose report option is still available for more
   detailed review.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  The dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl file is now available for the UPF hierarchical
   flow. There are several differences between the non-multivoltage and the
   multivoltage version of this script.  These will not be documented here.

*  The new ${HIERARCHICAL_DESIGNS} variable, defined in common_setup.tcl,
   is now used in the script.  Make sure that this variable is added to
   your common_setup.tcl file.

dc_scripts/fm.tcl changes:
--------------------------

*  Milkyway support information updated in the comments.

dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl changes:
------------------------------

*  The dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl file is now available for the UPF hierarchical
   flow. There are several differences between the nonmultivoltage and
   multivoltage versions of this script.  These differences are not
   documented here.  Please examine the scripts for details.


B-2008.09-SP1
=============

*  This is the first release that allows you to customize the reference
   methodology scripts by using flow settings from the SolvNet GUI interface.

*  The dc_MV.tcl and fm_MV.tcl files are no longer included as separate files.
   If the multivoltage flow is selected in the reference methodology
   generation options, dc.tcl and fm.tcl are contained in the multivoltage flow.

*  The dc_MV.upf file has been renamed to dc.upf and is included only for
   multivoltage flows.

*  The dc_top.tcl and fm_top.tcl files are not included unless a hierarchical
   flow without multivoltage is selected in the reference methodology
   generation options.

*  A pointer to SolvNet has been added for more information about UPFgen,
   a Tcl utility for quickly generating a UPF template file.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------
No changes.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  ICC_ILM_DESIGNS comment changed.  The same set of scripts will be usable
   once IC Compiler ILM support has been restored in a future service pack.

dc_scripts/dc(_top).tcl common changes:
---------------------------------------

*  Clock gating setup section enhanced

   o  Reworded comment header
   o  Added set_clock_gate_latency setup to support the
      compile_ultra -gate_clock command.

   o  Added comments to physical constraint reading and writing that explain
      the following options:

      -site_row
      -pre_route

   o  Tcl constraints now make use of built-in fuzzy name matching
      capabilities.

*  Added the multicore optimization option to compile_ultra -num_cpus, with
   a pointer to supporting usage documentation.

*  Modified the DFT for Clock Gating section to document the new insert_dft
   command-based test port hookup flow.

*  Added the -physical option to the report_area command for Design Compiler
   topographical mode.


B-2008.09
=========

*  The following new Formality reference methodology scripts have been added:

   o  dc_scripts/fm_MV.tcl (top-down multivoltage Formality script with UPF)
   o  dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl (top-level Formality script for dc_top.tcl)

*  Setup scripts are now sourced verbosely before the file header comment
   block to improve logging of script flow.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added the MW_REFERENCE_CONTROL_FILE variable definition.

   o  The IC Compiler Reference Methodology assumes that this variable is
      defined and that the tool can use it.
   o  The Design Compiler Reference Methodology does not make use of this
      setting.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  ICC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS is commented out temporarily for the hierarchical flow
   in version B-2008.09:

   #############################################################################
   # Note: IC Compiler ILM support is temporarily unavailable in the B-2008.09
   # release due to Milkyway compatibility issues.  There is a plan to fix this
   # in a later service pack release.
   #############################################################################

*  Added set_mw_lib_reference to the Milkyway library setup.

   This resolves cases where Milkyway reference library changes
   result in a Milkyway design library mismatch.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV)(_top).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------------

*  Removed "set_max_area 0" from the scripts.

   This is the default behavior now for full and incremental compile_ultra.

*  Removed the "set_max_total_power" power optimization constraint.

   o  No longer recommended to use this constraint.
   o  You can now use all combinations of the set_max_leakage_power
      and set_max_dynamic_power commands.

*  Removed comment that power prediction does not support ILMs.

   ILMs are now supported with power prediction enabled.

*  Added clarification that DFT signal definitions define TestMode signals only for
   hookup_testports.

   o  Remaining TestMode signals should be defined after hookup_testports.
   o  Added separate TestMode signal definition for ADAPTIVE SCAN.
   o  Recommended also for previous releases.

*  Note added that hookup_testports functionality has been integrated
   into insert_dft.

*  Revised the DFT clock-mixing specification to clarify differences between block
   and top-level settings in a hierarchical flow.

*  Added the -capture_procedure multi_clock option to create_test_protocol command.

   This option is recommended for the ATPG flow.

*  Added the "-names verilog" option to the write_test_protocol command for regular
   scan mode.

   o  Missing in previous reference methodology releases.
   o  Also recommended for previous releases.

*  Added the set_svf -off command, which is recommended for closing and
   writing automated setup (.svf) file.

   Closes the .svf file and makes it available earlier in the flow.

*  Uncommented the report_congestion command by default in the reporting section.

   This command requires a license for Design Compiler Graphical.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------

*  Reorganized the output and reporting sections.

   o  Output design data early to snapshot and allow parallel analysis.
   o  Design data is still saved if reporting fails.

*  Moved the write_milkyway command to the bottom of the script.

   o  Also added a comment about not using write_milkyway when creating
      a Design Compiler ILM.
   o  Can be done also in previous releases.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Added section to prevent upwards boundary optimization from physical blocks.

   o  Requirement for hierarchical Formality verification flow.
   o  Recommended also for previous releases.

*  Added specification of DFT MAX integration strategy, which is
   recommended also for previous releases.

------------------------------------

*  Removed the enable_ao_synthesis variable setting.

   o  Now enabled by default.
   o  Fully supported by the multivoltage flow (no reason to disable).

*  Enhanced the multivoltage reporting section.

   o  Added the following reports:

      report_power_switch
      report_level_shifter
      report_isolation_cell
      report_retention_cell

   o  Redirected the multivoltage reports to the report directory.

dc_scripts/fm.tcl changes:
--------------------------

*  Added the following note:

   Due to Milkyway schema changes in the B-2008.09 release for both Design Compiler and IC Compiler, Formality versions earlier than B-2008.12 do not support reading
   the Milkyway design from Design Compiler version B-2008.09.

   o  Recommended that you not use Milkyway design input until version B-2008.12.
   o  Note that Milkyway design input is not supported for the UPF flow (fm_MV.tcl).

*  Removed case conversion for Milkyway design name.

   Issue is fixed in the version B-2008.09 Formality release.


A-2007.12-SP2
=============

*  Reference Methodology MV/MS reference script has been migrated to a UPF flow:

   o  dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl (top-down multivoltage synthesis script)
   o  dc_scripts/dc_MV.upf (example UPF file)

   Note:
       The multivoltage hierarchical flow is not yet available.
       The dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl script is for top-down use only.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added DESIGN_REF_DATA_PATH to be used as a prefix for absolute paths in the
   common_setup.tcl file variable settings.

   Absolute paths are required for the hierarchical reference methodology flow.

*  Added additional power domain definition example.

   Note:
       Actual number of power domains is design specific.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------
No changes.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV)(_top).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------------

*  Added section to apply top-level operating conditions (required for MV flow).

*  Added -congestion as a new compile_ultra option.

*  Redirected hookup_testports command output to a separate log file.

*  Added optional congestion reporting to output section

*  Removed "saif_map -stop" from the scripts

   o  Syntax was incorrect
   o  The saif_map database must be kept on for read_saif
      (before report_power) to work.

dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl unique changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Made changes to avoid design renaming/linking conflicts for hierarchical blocks

   o  RTL versions of the hierarchical designs are now removed prior to saving
      an elaborated design.
   o  The link command is removed after reading elaborated design to avoid Presto
      rebuilding the RTL version.
   o  The list_designs -show_file command is added to verify that the correct design
      versions have been linked.

*  Reorganized design data output section reorganized for consistency.

dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl unique changes:
------------------------------------

*  Note that the new dc_MV.tcl script must be run with Design Compiler in UPF mode
   (-upf_mode option to dc_shell).

*  Added a check to exit if not in UPF mode.

*  The enable_ao_synthesis command is now enabled by default in the script.

*  The {DESIGN_NAME}.upf UPF file is used for design MV setup.

   o  Design specific sections have been removed from the main script.
   o  Script will exit if necessary UPF loading is not successful.
   o  Final UPF is saved as a part of the design data output.

*  The ${DESIGN_NAME}.set_voltage.tcl file is read for the design-specific
   set_voltage commands.

   o  set_voltage is not covered by UPF or SDC.
   o  Use this setup file also in IC Compiler.

*  Added information about multivoltage-specific set_scan_configuration options.

*  New multivoltage script has single multivoltage violation check after synthesis
   is completed.

A-2007.12-SP1
=============

*  The Design Compiler Reference Methodology now includes scripts for a
   hierarchical flow:

   o  dc_scripts/dc.tcl, the existing top-down script, can be used as a block-level
      script.
   o  dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl is the new top-level integration script.

   Note:
       The multivoltage hierarchical flow is not yet available.

       The dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl script is for top-down use only.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  Added hierarchical flow design variables:

   o  DDC_HIER_DESIGNS:     List of Design Compiler hierarchical design names
   o  DC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS:  List of Design Compiler ILM hierarchical design names
   o  ICC_ILM_HIER_DESIGNS: List of IC Compiler ILM hierarchical design names

*  Added the Milkyway check_library command to verify Milkyway library setup.

*  Added section to include IC Compiler ILMs in link library.

   Using IC Compiler ILMs requires Milkyway library setup.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV).tcl common changes:
--------------------------------------

*  Migrated the clock-gating flow to use compile_ultra -gate_clock.

   o  Removed insert_clock_gating.
   o  Removed propagate_constraints -gate_clock.
   o  Added -gate_clock to default compile_ultra options.
   o  Moved report_clock_gating to final reports section.

*  Commented out power prediction is by default.

   o  Power prediction in topographical mode is enabled automatically when using
      power constraints.
   o  You can explicitly enable power prediction with by using the
      set_power_prediction true variable.
   o  Power prediction can not be enabled when using IC Compiler ILMs.

*  Reorganized the DFT output section.

   o  "write_scan_def" must be run before writing binary design files
   o  Binary SCANDEF is now stored in .ddc files
   o  "check_scan_def" added to verify SCANDEF integrity

dc_scripts/dc.tcl unique changes:
---------------------------------

*  Added read_sdc to read budgeted constraints for hierarchical flow (commented out).

*  Added forced design uniquification with design name prefix for hierarchical flow.

   This prevents possible name collisions when integrating hierarchical designs at the top-level.

*  Added optional ILM creation step at the end of the hierarchical flow.

   Note:
       These new sections are specific for the hierarchical flow and are commented out
       by default. Uncomment them if using this as a block-level script in a
       hierarchical flow.


A-2007.12
=========

*  The Design Compiler Reference Methodology now includes a Formality reference
   script: dc_scripts/fm.tcl.

common_setup.tcl changes:
-------------------------

*  Added the MIN_ROUTING_LAYER and MAX_ROUTING_LAYER variables for
   the set_ignored_layers command in Design Compiler and IC Compiler.

   Design Compiler now supports the same syntax as IC Compiler for set_ignored_layers.

*  Removed the VA and VA_CELLS variables from the multivoltage Common
   Variables section.

   The voltage area name and cells are now derived from the PD definitions
   and must match.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  The script has been reorganized to allow shared setup by
   Design Compiler and Formality:

   o  Automatic conditional checks added for dc_shell.
   o  Milkyway setup variables moved up to common section for all tools.

*  The DCT_IGNORED_ROUTING_LAYERS variable has been removed:

   o  The syntax of set_ignored_layers has changed to match IC Compiler
      version A-2007.12.
   o  Replaced by MIN_ROUTING_LAYER and MAX_ROUTING_LAYER in the
      common_setup.tcl file.

dc_scripts/dc(_MV).tcl common changes:
-------------------------------------

*  Design Read

   o  Save elaborated design after read for use in same release (could
      also be done in previous releases).

*  Design Constraints

   Added option to enable multiple clocks per register (MCPR) consideration in optimization and timing analysis:

   o  This can also be used in previous releases as needed.
   o  Requires that all clock domain exceptions be specified to avoid
      unnecessary runtime.

*  Physical Constraints

   The set_ignored_layers command now uses the -min_routing_layer
   and -max_routing_layer options the same way IC Compiler uses them.

*  Compile

   Added the compile_ultra -check_only option to verify library
   and design setup prior to running topographical mode synthesis.

*  Output Files

   Added the write_parasitics command for topographical mode synthesis. This can also be used in previous releases.

dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl only changes:
---------------------------------

*  The create_voltage_area command now uses the -power_domain option to link voltage
   areas to power domain definitions.

   The -name option and cell_list names should no longer be used in A-2007.12 due to possible definition conflicts.

*  Additional level_shifter check and optional insertion added after insert_dft
   (needed for some libraries).


Z-2007.03-SP1
=============

*  The Reference Methodology now includes a multivoltage/multiscenario
   reference script: dc_scripts/dc_MV.tcl

common_setup.tcl changes:
------------------------

*  Added new section to define common multivoltage variables used by
   both Design Compiler and IC Compiler.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
---------------------

*  Added conditional check for pre-existence of $mw_design_library
   before executing create_mw_lib.


Z-2007.03
=========

*  First new version of Design Compiler Reference Methodology for
   the Z-2007.03 release.

dc_setup.tcl changes:
--------------------
*  Added DCT_IGNORED_ROUTING_LAYERS.

   Using the same ignored layers that is used for placement and routing
   improves correlation.

*  Changed Milkyway library setup to use create_mw_lib and open_mw_lib
   instead of create_mw_design.

   The new Milkyway UI is consistent with IC Compiler.

*  Added check_tlu_plus_files.

   This command is supported in Design Compiler version Z-2007.03
   for the TLU+ consistency check.

dc_scripts/dc.tcl changes:
--------------------------
*  Made changes for the new Switching Activity Interchange Format (SAIF) name
   mapping flow, which changes your SAIF flow in version Z-2007.03):

   o  Removed power_preserve_rtl_hier_names; replaced by a new flow.
   o  Added the following commands for PrimeTime PX:

      saif_map -start
      read_saif -auto_map_names
      saif_map -stop
      saif_map -write_map

*  The default clock gating style is now recommended for most cases.

   The set_clock_gating_style command is now commented out.

*  Added set_ignored_layers, which uses the DCT_IGNORED_ROUTING_LAYERS
   defined in dc_setup.tcl.

   Using the same ignored layers that are used in placement and routing improves correlation.

*  Physical constraints:

   o  The extract_physical_constraints command no longer needs scripted name
      translation in version Z-2007.03.
   o  The set_fuzzy_query_options command has been added for
      extract_physical_constraints automatic name matching.

*  Compile:

   Added the new -retime option for adaptive retiming to the list of recommended
   compile_ultra options.

*  DFT Setup:

   o  Added a section explaining how to handle new test ports created
      in a Design Compiler session.

   o  DFT setup for clock gating has been changed in version Z-2007.03:

      Removed:

      -- test_dft_drc_ungate_clocks
      -- test_dft_drc_ungate_internal_clocks test_setup_additional_clock_pulse

      Added:

      -- set_dft_drc_configuration -clock_gating_init_cycles

   o  The following setting is no longer conditional:

      set_dft_insertion_configuration -synthesis_optimization none

      This is now the setting that you should always use to be consistent in all
      Design Compiler modes.

*  DFT incremental compile now always runs the following command:

   compile_ultra -incremental -scan

   Design Compiler supports the compile_ultra -incremental command in
   version Z-2007.03.

*  SDC output cleanup avoids writing RC information by setting the
   following variables (recommended also for version Y-2006.06):

   set write_sdc_output_lumped_net_capacitance false
   set write_sdc_output_net_resistance false


Y-2006.06-A
===========

*  Initial release of the Design Compiler Reference Methodology and
   only version for Y-2006.06
