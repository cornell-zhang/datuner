High-level synthesis Begin
Parser starting - we'll create an abstract syntax tree.  Note this tree can be viewed using GraphViz (see documentation)
Optimizing module by AST based optimizations
Converting AST into a Netlist. Note this netlist can be viewed using GraphViz (see documentation)
Performing Optimizations of the Netlist

Hard Logical Memory Distribution
============================
DPRAM: 61 width 3 depth
DPRAM: 32 width 2 depth
DPRAM: 60 width 6 depth

Total Logical Memory Blocks = 3 
Total Logical Memory bits = 4456 
Max Memory Width = 61 
Max Memory Depth = 6 

Performing Partial Map to target device
Outputting the netlist to the specified output format
Successful High-level synthesis by Odin in 360.2ms
