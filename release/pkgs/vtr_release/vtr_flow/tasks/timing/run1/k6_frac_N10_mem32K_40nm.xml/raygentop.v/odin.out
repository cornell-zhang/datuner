High-level synthesis Begin
Parser starting - we'll create an abstract syntax tree.  Note this tree can be viewed using GraphViz (see documentation)
Optimizing module by AST based optimizations
Converting AST into a Netlist. Note this netlist can be viewed using GraphViz (see documentation)
Performing Optimizations of the Netlist

Hard Logical Memory Distribution
============================
SPRAM: 21 width 8 depth

Total Logical Memory Blocks = 1 
Total Logical Memory bits = 5376 
Max Memory Width = 21 
Max Memory Depth = 8 

Performing Partial Map to target device
Outputting the netlist to the specified output format

Hard Multiplier Distribution
============================
8 X 7 => 9
16 X 16 => 9


Total # of multipliers = 18
